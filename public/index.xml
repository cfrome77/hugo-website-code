      <description>My Coin Collection Getting Started My coin collecting began when my dad gave me my first coin book. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember my exact age, but I must have been 7 or 8. He have me one of the unfinished Lincoln penny books he had from his collection. I was also given a big book of the U.S. to use for collecting the state quarters (1999 - 2008). From there I have continued to grow my collection and a love for coin collecting.</description>

      <description>Dutch Oven Cast Iron Cooking One of my favorite things to use for cooking is the dutch oven. I got my first introduction to using cast iron from being in the Boy Scouts. The dutch oven makes for easy one dish meals with easy cleanup. You can make everything from breakfast casseroles to soup/stew, pizza or even dessert. Cast iron in general, is great not just for camping but is great when cooking at home too.</description>
