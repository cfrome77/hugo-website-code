About Me
--------

My name is Chris. I'm a recent alumnus of James Madison University (May 2018) where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Environmental Information Systems. 
My interests within Computer Science include: software engineering/DevOps, full stack web development, and security. 
I first learned about programming starting in high school, and am excited to start a new career as a Software Engineer.
Aside from programming and computer science I enjoy cooking, rock climbing, and camping/the outdoors.
