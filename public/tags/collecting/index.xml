      <description>My Coin Collection Getting Started My coin collecting began when my dad gave me my first coin book. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember my exact age, but I must have been 7 or 8. He have me one of the unfinished Lincoln penny books he had from his collection. I was also given a big book of the U.S. to use for collecting the state quarters (1999 - 2008). From there I have continued to grow my collection and a love for coin collecting.</description>
